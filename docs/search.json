Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued an MSc in Construction Science and Implementation Techniques, in our dissertation, my partners and I innovated a novel clay material characterized by its sustainability and remarkable durability, capable of withstanding substantial tension and pressure forces. This achievement contributed in earning a distinction degree. During my previous master’s program, I worked as a senior architect, overseeing the design and construction of buildings across various functions. Additionally, I actively contributed to the regeneration and planning efforts in multiple areas within my country. Driven by my interest in the transformative potential of urban planning and the role of smart cities in societal advancement, I decided to pursue an MSc in Urban Spatial Science at UCL. I’m enthusiastic about exploring how data can be leveraged to create and enrich the fabric of our communities, so this is me and here I’m.\nBeside Architecture, urban planning and construction I really love taking photos , capturing beautiful moments, and travailing around the world\n\n\n\nMe on of the construction site (on the corner of a flying canopy)\n\n\n\n\n\nRichmond park Deers this was captured by me."

    "text": "1.1 Summary\nIn this lecture, we delved into the world of remotely sensing cities, and learned about the methods used to collect data using sensors that are mounted on various of platforms (space-borne/airborne). We explored the two main types of sensors: passive, which detect natural radiation, and active, which emit their own radiation. We also explored the differences between Sentinel 2 and Landsat satellites in terms of spectral bands, spatial resolution, and revisit frequency. Finally, we discussed that electromagnetic radiation can be obstructed by surfaces or the atmosphere, causing absorption, transmission, or scattering.\n\n\n\nFigure (1): Active and Passive sensors. website: (https://www.balamis.com/technology/)\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Remote sensing definition\nAccording to NASA “Remote sensing is the acquiring of information from a distance”. By observing the energy response (reflected, transmitted) and recording information then use it in responding to hazards, apply energy studies utilizing, urban planning, and environmental treaty enforcement…..etc.\n\n\n1.1.2 The process of remote sensing\nElectromagnetic energy, created by moving charged particles, travels in waves through space and the atmosphere. These waves vary in length and frequency; shorter waves have higher frequencies. Electromagnetic waves might get obstructed by a surface or atmosphere which cause scattering for the short wave such as blues and then it reflects back to be recorded and processed to information/data.\n\n\n\nFigure (2): the remote sensing process website: (https://paititi.info/research-technology/remote-sensing-from-space/)\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Sentinel-2 VS Landsat\nSentinel-2 The SENTINEL-2 mission consists of two satellites orbiting in the same path around the Earth, but spaced 180° apart. They’re designed to continuously observe changes in land surface conditions. With a wide coverage area and a rapid revisit time of 10 days at the equator.\nLandsat 8 The Landsat 8 satellite carries two main instruments: the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). These sensors capture images of the Earth’s surface at various resolutions, including 30 meters for visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared data; 100 meters for thermal data; and 15 meters for panchromatic data"

    "text": "1.2 Application\nLandsat and Sentinel 2 have been used extensively in different fields including land use planning and monitoring, emergency response and management, water use monitoring and others. Each one of those two methods has its strengths and to understand those strengths, we will leverage an analysis that was conducted to evaluate and compare between those two data sources in forest fires mapping article. This analysis compares and assesses spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 OLI imagery and to identify the most appropriate iindex for each sensor for accurately mapping forest fires, using as a case study two fire events that occurred in summer 2017 in northern Tunisia (Achour et al. 2022, Toujani et al. 2022).\n\n\n\nFigure (2): Sentinel 2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images were acquired before (pre-fire) and after (post-fire) the fires from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Discussion\nResults from this study highlight those spectral indices including NIR-SWIR bands derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI (ΔNBRn, ΔNBR and RBR) had higher discriminatory power than classical indices based on NIR and red bands (BAI, ΔNDVI, ΔEVI, and ΔMSAVI).\nIn the figure below, we can see that spectral indices derived from Landsat 8, especially those combining the Red-NIR bands such as ΔNDVI, ΔEVI and ΔMSAVI exhibited a higher spectral separability as compared to their counterparts generated from Sentinel bands in both fires.\n\n\n\nFigure (3): M-statistic values to discern burned/unburned areas for both Sentinel 2 (S) and Landsat-8 OLI (L) spectral indices\n\n\nMaps of the estimated burned areas from each spectral index and for each fire reveals that both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A can capture the boundaries of fires identified using Copernicus EMS reference maps, albeit with small differences between burned areas, retrieved from each sensor.\nSentinel-based spectral indices (ΔNBRn and RBR) provided the highest level of positional accuracy, with a loc value of about 60 metres. This means that the positions of the extracted fires were shifted approximately by three pixels from their positions in the reference map. However, Landsat-based spectral indices, RBR and ΔNBR, displayed a loc value of about 75 meters, suggesting that the position of the extracted fires were shifted approximately 2.5 pixels from their positions in the reference map. The advantage of Sentinel 2A in terms of positional accuracy could be attributed to its higher spatial resolution as compared to Landsat 8.\n\n\n\nFigure (4): Distribution of burned and unburned values for spectral indices selected for F1 / F2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure (5): Spectral indices vs. Copernicus EMS fire polygon for the Haddada fire\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Conclusion\nThe study concluded that (1) regardless of the sensor, spectral indices that incorporated NIR-SWIR bands exceed those using red and NIR bands in terms of spectral separability; (2) from the viewpoint of accuracy, the Sentinel sensor is slightly more efficient than the Landsat 8 in mapping burned scars, but both sensors produce similar and acceptable results. Hence, this paper concludes that both sensors are a good alternative to EFFIS data, particularly when there is a need to detect details inside the fire. I still have to add so what and why it is useful:"

This lecture opened my eyes to the uses of satellite data and the importance of it and how it can be used in different areas and in very different methods but what was really interesting for me is the paper that i found on the use of satellite images in capturing the socioeconomic disruption during the Ukrainian war. In this study they combined satellite data on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to track changes in human activities, as both gases are linked to fossil fuel combustion. the analysis reveals a significant decrease in NO2 levels over major Ukrainian cities, power plants, and industrial areas during the second quarter of 2022, ranging from 15% to 46% compared to the reference period of 2018-2021. They also used the detection of unusual fire which might be likley from shelling rather than agricultural burning.These findings demonstrate the value of satellite observations in monitoring significant societal changes, particularly during conflicts."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nIn this lecture, we had a look about the difference between Push broom and Whisk broom Sensors, then we discovered that satellite images usually might has flaws. Geometric Correction, Atmospheric Correction, Topographic Correction, and Radiometric are all methods to correct the remote sensing products. The next part of the lecture was about the joining data techniques and how to make enhancement on the images.\n\n3.1.1 Geometric Correction.\nThe process involves taking the coordinates of the dataset, applying a mathematical model to determine the transformation coefficients, and then using these coefficients to perform the geometric transformation, effectively altering the spatial arrangement of the features in the dataset. In other words it is the “ attempt to correct for positional errors and to transform the original image into a new image that has the geometric characteristics of a map. can you rephrase” I should add the citation (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/geometric-correction#:~:text=Geometric%20corrections%20attempt%20to%20correct,geometric%20characteristics%20of%20a%20map.)\n\n\n\nFigure (1) Geometric Correction process\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Atmospheric Correction.\nAtmospheric correction is the process of eliminating scattering and absorption effects caused by the atmosphere, thereby revealing the surface reflectance that represents surface properties.\nMethods to remove the atmosphere effect:\nRelative: involves normalising images, which simplifies comparison with other images instead of directly eliminating atmospheric effects. One common technique for relative correction is Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), where dark objects with very low reflectance are subtracted from the image. This process not only standardizes the image but also mitigates atmospheric effects.\n\n\n\nFigure (2) Dark pixel subtraction source: (Remote Sensing Research center https://www.rsrc.org.au/)\n\n\nAbsolute: involves assessing atmospheric conditions, along with the angles of illumination and viewing during image acquisition, to estimate the levels of scattering and absorption for each image band. Based on these factors, correction factors are determined to adjust the data from its initial at-sensor values to more accurate at-surface values.\nEmpirical line method: is an atmospheric correction technique that offers an alternative to radiative transfer modeling approaches. It provides a relatively straightforward approach to calibrating surface reflectance, as long as a series of calibration target measurements that remain constant over time are accessible.\nPhases of Atmospheric Correction\nAtmospheric correction is a two-phase process. In the initial phase, Digital Numbers (DNs) are transformed into radiance, and subsequently into top-of-atmosphere radiance. In the subsequent phase, top-of-atmosphere reflectance is converted to surface reflectance, also known as bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance or top-of-canopy reflectance, particularly in vegetation studies. The output image from this process is referred to as atmospherically corrected.\n\n\n\nFigure (3) Phases of Atmospheric correction source: (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/atmospheric-correction-dinesh-shrestha/)"

    "section": "3.2 Application",
    "text": "3.2 Application\nApplying atmospheric corrections on satellite images is a crucial step that should be performed before conducting any further analysis or processing using those images. However, as we saw earlier, there are multiple approaches with different techniques that varies from image-based empirical correction to model-based methods. Each one of these techniques has its strength and weakness and, in this section, we will highlight two main studies that compared between different approaches like (QUAC, FLAASH and DOS). Those studies are \"Comparison and evaluation of atmospheric correction algorithms of QUAC, DOS and FLAASH for HICO hyperspectral imagery\" (Shi, Mao, 2016) and \"A Comparison of Image-Based and Physics-Based Atmospheric Correction Methods for Extracting Snow and Vegetation Cover in Nepal Himalayas Using Landsat 8 OLI Images\" (Niraj, Gupta 2022).\nComparison for HICO hyperspectral imagery paper:\nThis study concludes that all three types of corrections (FLAASH, QUAC, DOS) can remove the effect of atmosphere for HICO hyperspectral image. It also confirms that based on analysing the situ data, FLAASH model have a better performance than QUAC and DOS methods for reducing effect of atmosphere HICO images. Having said that, both QUAC and DOS depend on less input parameters and their computational speed is much faster than FLAASH.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison for extracting snow and vegetation cover in Nepal Himalayas paper:\nIn this study, eight correction methods were applied on Landsat 8 OLI satellite image to find the best model for mapping snow and vegetation covered areas. The study found that FLAASH and 6SV methods determined best snow reflectance values, while DOS3 and QUAC were the worst. Additionally, FLAASH and SIAC methods showed greater vegetation reflectance values and higher ranks of correlating the extracted vegetation spectra with the standard spectra while DOS and QUAC were the lowest.\nThe study found when compared to other image-based correction methods (QUAC, Aref, COST, DOS, and DOS3), the FLAASH, SIAC, and 6SV methods generate higher snow and vegetation mean reflectance values, thus having a high possibility of mapping true snow and vegetation features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nBoth studies explore different atmospheric correction methods for remote sensing imagery, with a focus on varying types of imagery and target variables. The first study evaluates FLAASH, QUAC, and DOS correction methods for HICO hyperspectral imagery, concluding that FLAASH performs better in removing atmospheric effects despite its slower computational speed. In contrast, the second study assesses eight correction methods applied to Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery to map snow and vegetation cover in the Nepal Himalayas, finding that FLAASH and SIAC methods produce superior results for snow and vegetation reflectance. Ultimately, it’s not possible to determine that one method is superior to another. Therefore, the selection of an atmospheric correction method relies on the specific objectives and characteristics of the remote sensing analysis."

Understanding the various correction methods available is essential, as each method serves a distinct purpose. Moreover, selecting the appropriate method depends on the variables and characteristics of the analysis at hand. While I hope to avoid the need for performing corrections myself, as you mentioned, gaining insight into these behind-the-scenes processes has been enlightening and beneficial."
